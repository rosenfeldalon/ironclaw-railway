[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/4VTN88?referralCode=4pD7Sc&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=generic)

Deploy IronClaw on Railway with PostgreSQL and pgvector.

This repository provides a Railway-ready deployment wrapper for IronClaw so it can run correctly in a hosted environment without the common issues that appear when deploying the upstream project directly.

## Overview

IronClaw is a secure AI assistant with chat, memory, jobs, routines, and a web interface. This repository adapts IronClaw for Railway by adding the pieces needed for a smooth hosted deployment.

This setup handles the major problems that usually appear in Railway:

- skipping interactive first-run onboarding
- avoiding localhost-only gateway access
- preventing port conflicts between the gateway and HTTP webhook channel
- running behind a public HTTP wrapper
- using PostgreSQL with pgvector for persistence
- making deployment easier for users who do not want to inspect logs manually

## What this template includes

This Railway template includes:

- IronClaw application service
- PostgreSQL service with pgvector
- public web access through a wrapper/proxy layer
- non-interactive startup for hosted environments
- persistent PostgreSQL storage
- private internal networking between services

## Why this wrapper exists

The upstream IronClaw project is designed mainly for local or self-managed environments. When deploying to Railway, several things need to be adapted:

- the default onboarding flow is interactive
- the internal gateway runs on localhost
- the public web entrypoint must listen on the Railway service port
- the webhook channel must not conflict with the public proxy port
- hosted users need a cleaner out-of-the-box experience

This repository solves those issues so the app starts correctly on Railway.

## Architecture

This deployment uses two services.

### 1. ironclaw

The main application service built from this repository.

Responsibilities:

- starts IronClaw with Railway-friendly configuration
- skips interactive onboarding
- proxies public traffic to the internal IronClaw gateway
- keeps the UI accessible from the Railway public domain

### 2. Postgres

A PostgreSQL database service using pgvector.

Responsibilities:

- stores IronClaw data persistently
- supports vector-based features through pgvector
- stays private inside Railway internal networking

Recommended Postgres image:

    pgvector/pgvector:pg16-trixie

## Key Railway-specific changes

This wrapper includes several important deployment changes.

### 1. Non-interactive startup

Interactive first-run onboarding is skipped by preconfiguring the required environment variables for hosted deployment.

### 2. Public wrapper/proxy

IronClaw’s internal gateway runs locally, while the wrapper exposes the public Railway HTTP port and forwards traffic correctly.

### 3. Port separation

The public wrapper and IronClaw HTTP webhook channel run on separate ports to avoid bind conflicts.

Recommended split:

- public wrapper: 8080
- IronClaw webhook channel: 8081
- internal IronClaw gateway: 3000

### 4. Persistent database

Postgres uses a mounted volume so data survives redeploys.

### 5. Railway-friendly networking

- IronClaw is exposed publicly
- Postgres stays private
- internal service communication uses Railway private networking

## Environment variables

### IronClaw service

Use these variables on the IronClaw service:

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${{Postgres.POSTGRES_USER}}:${{Postgres.POSTGRES_PASSWORD}}@Postgres.railway.internal:5432/${{Postgres.POSTGRES_DB}}?sslmode=disable
    LLM_BACKEND=openai
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ONBOARD_COMPLETED=true
    SANDBOX_ENABLED=false
    PORT=8080
    HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0
    HTTP_PORT=8081
    HTTP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=${{ secret(32) }}

### Postgres service

Use these variables on the Postgres service:

    POSTGRES_DB=ironclaw
    POSTGRES_USER=ironclaw
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${{ secret(16) }}
    PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata

## Storage

### Postgres volume

Enable a persistent volume for Postgres.

Recommended mount path:

    /var/lib/postgresql/data

## Networking

### IronClaw service

- public HTTP domain enabled
- public wrapper listens on port 8080

### Postgres service

- no public domain
- private networking only
- persistent volume enabled

## User experience notes

After deployment, the app loads through the Railway public domain and opens the IronClaw UI.

This wrapper was updated to solve:

- first-run onboarding issues
- gateway accessibility problems
- HTTP webhook secret requirement
- port collision between Caddy and IronClaw HTTP channel
- Railway public access routing

## Repository files

This repository includes:

- `Dockerfile` — builds and packages the Railway-ready runtime
- `Caddyfile` — exposes the public Railway port and proxies traffic to IronClaw
- `docker-entrypoint.sh` — starts IronClaw and the public proxy with the required startup behavior
- `README.md` — deployment instructions and template information

## Recommended use cases

This template is a good fit for:

- personal AI assistant hosting
- secure chat and memory workflows
- routine and job automation
- hosted demos of IronClaw
- fast Railway-based evaluation environments

## Important notes

- This repository is a Railway deployment wrapper, not the upstream IronClaw project itself.
- The upstream project remains the source for IronClaw application development.
- This wrapper focuses specifically on reliable Railway deployment behavior.
